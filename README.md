Debouncing
--- debouncing is a concept with which when we type ir search on evry key press an API is called so on large scale when we need to optimise the performance so we use this  concept of debouncing.

Iphone pro max=14 letters * 1000= 14000 api calls, that is on typing of ech alphabet if there will be an api called then when thousand of users will do then it will in thousands..

with Debouncing 
Iphone pro max=14 letters but 3 times api called so 3*1000= 3000 so basicslly it is better
